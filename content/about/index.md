I'm a freelance developer, focusing on:

 - System Design
 - API Development (mainly using Django, partly NodeJs)
 - Chatbot Development

I'm spending half of my time for managing and developing a special children center (children with some difficulty) called [Cadeaux](https://www.facebook.com/thamvantamlydanang). I love improving business processes, and always to try to make work with people and tech.

I aslo instruct a meditation technique called Sahaja Yoga for free.

The remaining time I use to think about ideas to develop community, and I'm trying to start some small businesses as a test.

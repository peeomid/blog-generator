Simple framework for Facebook Messenger chat bot in Python. 
<!--more-->

An attempt to structure a simple "framework" (well, not exactly, just a simple structure) for Facebook Messenger chatbot.

I've come across many tutorials on the net on how to develop Facebook Messenger chatbot in Python, but so far I haven't seen any well structured one, yet. [botkit](https://www.botkit.ai/)'s code is way more readable to me.

So, just want to have a well-structured (or at least clearly structured) app for developing chatbot.

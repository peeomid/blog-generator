A todo that force me to get things done, not a todo to put things in then forget!
<!--more-->

I've used so many todo apps, but so far none has really "force" me to get things done. My tendency is to put a lot of stuff in the list, but then either I forget to check the list, or the list grows too big, managing the list itself takes too much time!
